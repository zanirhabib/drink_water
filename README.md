# drink_water

I am building an app to drink more water using twilio so that it texts me every so often letting me know to drink water

Basic functionality: Send a text to a phone number every 30 minutes reminding them to drink water

Later features:
- input times to start and stop sending texts
- being able to start/stop when you receive notifications

Prerequisites to run: 

```
pip install twilio
```
